# Module 7 - Event Listeners

## General Instructions

To run the tests you must first deploy the application, to do that make sure you are in the `before` directory (`~/workspace/before`) and then run `gradle cargeRedeployRemote` and then run `gradle build`. The first time you fun `gradle build` it may take a little while as it has to establish its environment bu subsequent uses of this command will be quicker.

The exercises have two directories, the `before` directory is where you will work and the `after ` directory contains the solution. If you want to check that the solution works then change directories to the `after` directory and run `gradle cargeRedeployRemote` and `gradle build`

## Deploy the application
